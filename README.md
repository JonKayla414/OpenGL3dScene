OpenGL 3D Scene 
How do I approach designing software?
You can take approached to designing a software with the SDLC. 
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
The new skills that I learned include the Open GL Framework.
What design process did you follow for your project work?
The design process that I followed include making a plan on how I wanted to implement the different objects into the project. 
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
Properly planning a new project will ensure the success of new project. 
 Overall this project has helped me evolve my criticaly thinking and problem solving skills. Open GL requires a lot of math like linear alegebra. In order to properly
 render objects and rotate them and translate them it requires us to solve how we want are graphics card to render different object.
